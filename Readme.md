# Project Name
Fitness AI Agents

## Overview
This project is a React application based on Fitness AI Agents

## .gitignore Explanation

The `.gitignore` file is used in Git to specify files and directories that should be ignored by version control. This means that any files or directories listed in this file will not be tracked by Git, preventing them from being included in commits.

### Ignored Files and Directories

1. **/node_modules**: 
    - This directory is where npm (Node Package Manager) installs all the dependencies for a JavaScript project.
    - Since these dependencies can be easily reinstalled using the `package.json` file, it is common practice to exclude the `node_modules` directory from version control.
    - This helps to keep the repository size manageable and avoids potential issues with platform-specific dependencies.

2. **.env**:
    - This file typically contains environment-specific variables, such as API keys, database connection strings, and other sensitive information.
    - By ignoring the `.env` file, you ensure that these sensitive details are not exposed in the version control system, enhancing the security of your project.
